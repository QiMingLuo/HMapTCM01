Description: HMapTCM is an R package designed to streamline the complexity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations through high-content fluorescent morphological profiling and computational combinatorial optimization. Leveraging single-herb perturbation signatures and their relative concentrations in original formulae, the toolkit generates in silico combinatorial libraries, computes morphological similarity metrics between virtual combinations and reference formulae, and employs a Pareto-optimized evolutionary algorithm to identify simplified yet pharmacologically faithful herb combinations.
